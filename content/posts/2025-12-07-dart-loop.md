### Overview
Very rowdy!! I'm  glad we didn't take beginners and I'm glad I had a strong group. Big bouncy fun, but with plenty of consequence waiting. Only take strong paddlers at this level.

### Feature Notes
* **Washing Machine** 
Straightforward at this level with this group - much the same as normal.

* **Lovers' Leap** 
Rocks almost entirely covered, just make sure you paddle hard to avoid the cliff at the end.

* **Triple Step**
Triple 1 was completely washed out. Triple 2 and 3 were awesome - massive wave train and I found myself actively cackling as I went down it. Rocks are almost enitrely convered on river right at the bottom, but the eddy remains.

* **Spindryer**
Even more logistically challenge than at 1.0 m. Eddies were non-exsistent at thte bottom, save for the spindryer itself. Our group had to eddy out much further down.


### Other Notes
Level was almost through the third arch, and probably was by the time we were off the river.
