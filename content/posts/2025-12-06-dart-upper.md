## Overview
About the upper level of what I'd want to be paddling (in a hurry?). I took a good few rolls and tweaked my head. Gd. 3 sections were a delightful bouncy time. Good fun, but pushy!

## Features
1. **Mad Mile** – The slides were a bit more retentive and so require care.
2. **S Bend** – Felt really nice and smooth at this level.
3. **Euthanasia** – Mostly pleasant at this level. The chute was a smooth ride down (boof supposedly also ran), but the eddies were small after this.
4. **Pandora's Box** – We ran the chute (the left). Go left until you see the eddy just above the drop, and then drive right.
5. **Magnetic Rock** – Hole is monchy.

## Other Notes
*Level: Newbridge slab was covered, but not through the third arch.
Swims would've been a pain here!
