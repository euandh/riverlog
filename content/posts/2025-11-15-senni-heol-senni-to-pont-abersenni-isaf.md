## Overview
It isn't just a tree lined ditch, it's also a tree filled ditch. I'm not convinced this is worth returning to. Portages were unpleasant but (mostly) possible.

## Experiences
This section starts a chill weir that has a gauge. The guidebook suggested the 4 we saw was in the middle of runnable. After this, the trees begin to get in the way.

The most notable "features" are a very small "s-bend" where a gate has fallen in the river just after a right hand bend; and the other is a massive tree spanning the river with no obvious portage - we had to wade under the only raised section to continue.

## Other Notes
Quite a winding section with lots of corners. It might be more interesting to start where we got off — or bring a saw. We walked off at the bridge (Pont Abersenni-isaf) because we were running out of light, this was ok as you could park on someone's driveway (they didn't seem to be home).
