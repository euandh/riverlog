## Overview
A front heavy section, mostly pleasant on this level. Not the most exciting features or river as a whole.

## Features
1. A small drop round a corner. You can just about do a line of sight from the eddy just above. Run hard right for a wave/tongue.
2. A ledge w/ easy sessioning, although not terribly interesting. Pick a safe/easy spot on the ledge. A far left chute is possible at different levels, but just looked miserable/painful at this level.
3. **Rockfest** on the RH side and a fun ledge on the left, but it does look like it will push you into a mid-river corner pocket of recirculation – I wouldn't want to try and reach a line to it. Portaged freshers w/ a seal launch.

## Other Notes
It's a long paddle out from there to Aberbran! Parking is minimal at Aberbran, leave any surplus vehicles at Maescar Community Hall in Sennybridge.
