## Overview
Rowdy!! Probably at the very upper end of what freshers should be on, maybe (likely) exceeding it? Inters will have a fantastic time. Boat chases chasing will be long.

## Features
1. **Washing Mach.** – Pretty washed out, chute line on left ran fab, we didn't try the hero. We had a long boat chase here.
2. **Lovers' Leap** – Start right under a tree and work to the left/middle. At this level, the "midway" eddy on the left is tricky – use only for signals. Boat chasing after here is a protracted affair.
3. **Triple Step** – Washed out. 1 is just a wave, eddy beforehand on the left and then drive to right-hand eddy. 2 is a big wave.
4. **Spin Dryer** – Logistically challenging. I sat at the top of the spin dryer eddy holding onto a tree to run signals, and there was just about a big enough eddy on river left.

## Other Notes
One beginner got a pretty bad concussion on lovers' and Emma/Vi saw their boats go past loves' after a swim at washing machine. Boat chases were very protracted.
